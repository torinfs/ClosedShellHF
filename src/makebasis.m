%Takes a list of atoms, their cartesian coordinates, and the basis set
%structure as provided by basisread(). Returns a structure array of all the
%basis functions.
%
%   Inputs:
%       atoms-       1xK list of atomic numbers (e.g. [6 8] for CO)
%       xyz-         Kx3 array of nulcear coordinates in angstroms. Must
%                    match order of nuclei in atoms list.
%       basissetdef- basis set structure as read in by basisread().
%                    For optimal memory performance, basisread() should be
%                    called in the argument list of makebasis(), so that it
%                    is deallocated after makebasis is finished.
%
%   Outputs:
%    basis-          1xM structure array (where M is the number of basis
%                    functions. basis contains the following fields.
%     basis(p).atom  Atomic number of central nucleus (e.g. 6 for C).
%     basis(p).A     Vector of cartesian coordinates of cetral nucleus in
%                    Bohr.
%     basis(p).a     Vector of x,y,z angular ("Cartesian") exponents
%     basis(p).alpha Array of radial exponents of primitives making up
%                    the basis function.
%     basis(p).d     Array of contraction coefficents of the primitives.
%     basis(p).N     Array of normalization constants.
%
%Support notes:
%   1) Only basis functions with 'S', 'P', 'D', or 'SP' type subshells are
%       currently supported.

%Actually preallocating the structure array. I'm not sure how MATLAB

%   and reduce time searching for an appropriate memory block.
